						<p><strong>Synopsis: </strong>Sauron's forces have laid siege to Minas Tirith,
						 	the capital of Gondor, in their efforts to eliminate the race of men. The once-great 
							kingdom, watched over by a fading steward, has never been in more desperate need 
							of its king. But can Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen) answer the call of his heritage and become 
							what he was born to be? In no small measure, the fate of Middle-earth rests on his broad shoulders.
							With the final battle joined and the legions of darkness gathering, Gandalf (Ian McKellen) urgently 
							tries to rally Gondor's broken army to action. 
						</p>
						<img src="pictures/LoTR-about.jpg" style="float:right; display:block;margin-left:10px;">
						<p>He is aided by Rohan's King Theoden(Bernard Hill), who unites his warriors 
							for history's biggest test. Yet even with the forces of men--with Eowyn 
							(Miranda Otto) and Merry (Dominic Monaghan) hidden among them--are no match 
							for the enemies swarming against Gondor. Still, in the face of great losses, 
							they charge forward into the battle of their lifetimes, tied together by their 
							singular goal to keep Sauron distracted and give the Ring Bearer a chance to 
							complete his quest. 
						</p>
						<p>Their hopes rest with Frodo (Elijah Wood), a tiny but 
							determined hobbit making a perilous trip across treacherous enemy lands to 
							cast the One Ring into the fires of Mount Doom. The closer Frodo gets to 
							his final destination, the heavier his burden becomes and the more he 
							must rely on Samwise Gamgee (Sean Astin). Gollum--and the Ring 
							itself--will test Frodo's allegiances and, ultimately, his humanity. 
							The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King concludes the epic story 
							of these characters, their relationships and rivalries, and reveals how 
							through courage, commitment and determination even the least of us can 
							change the world.  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Lord_of_the_Rings:_The_Return_of_the_King" class="more-info" target="_new blank">(more info)<a/>
